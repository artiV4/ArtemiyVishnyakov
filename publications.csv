"Distributed ML Property Attestation Using TEEs","Idil Kara, Gavin Deane, Artemiy Vishnyakov","2025","Unpublished","As large machine learning (ML) providers adopt model cards to document how models are trained, the question becomes: how can a verifier be sure that a card is honest? Prior work such as Laminator shows how a trusted execution environment (TEE) can produce a proof-of-training (PoT) artifact for a single node, attesting that its output model was trained on a specific dataset, architecture, and configuration. Modern training pipelines, however, are distributed and data-parallel. In this work we ask whether these single-node restrictions can be lifted to attest a distributed setting: if each individual node can attest that it behaved correctly, can we safely conclude that the whole system behaved correctly? Our key idea is to treat each worker as a Laminator-style prover and to run a coordinator inside a TEE that verifies worker PoT digests and aggregates their updates. Since the coordinator’s code is itself remotely attested, an external verifier only needs to trust the coordinator enclave; the distributed training job then collapses to a single PoT artifact stating that, if every node followed its attested code, the final model was trained as claimed or else the artifact fails to verify. We implement this protocol using PyTorch and a Docker-based TEE emulation, and evaluate it on data-parallel training over the CENSUS dataset. In our CPU-only prototype, attested runs incur a 2.2–3.1× slowdown (120–214% overhead) compared to an unattested baseline, with overhead scaling approximately linearly in the number of workers and epochs."
"Detection and Classification of Network Attacks using Machine Learning","Artemiy Vishnyakov","2025","Undergraduate Thesis","Created a system for the detection and classification of cyber-attacks on a network, designed without reliance on packet payload for classification to enhance privacy and efficiency. The work investigates the generalizability of the system to zero-day attacks and VPN traffic, ensuring robustness in diverse network environments. Two approaches were investigated: per-flow and per-packet classification, with accuracies of 99.38% and 86.72% respectively for the best models."
